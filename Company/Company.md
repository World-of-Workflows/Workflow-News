# Workflows News Company Structure

The Organisation is an example organisation, so we'd normally set up a Limited company and all that is required.

For this example, we will choose a company name that's not being used:

We asked ChatGPT to come up with some company anmes:

> Come up with 10 business names for my company whose first product is "Workflow News", a News Aggregator powered by World of Workflows

Certainly! Here are some business name ideas for your news aggregator company:

1. WorkFlowPress
2. NexaFlow News Co.
3. TaskStream Media
4. OmniFlow NewsCorp
5. ZenithWork News
6. ProcessPulse Media
7. WorkSync Digest
8. EffiStream News
9. OptiFlow Newsworks
10. QuotidianFlow Media

I hope these names help spark some inspiration for your venture!
