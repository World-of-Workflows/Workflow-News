## Reporting a Vulnerability

Your security is very important to us. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, please follow the guidelines below to report them:

1. **Do Not Open an Issue** – Please do not open a public issue on GitHub, as it can unintentionally expose vulnerabilities to a wider audience.
2. **Send a Private Disclosure** – Send your findings to our dedicated security email: [nick@worldofworkflows.com](mailto:nick@workldofworkflows.com).
3. **Provide Detailed Information** – The more details you can provide, the better. This will help us understand the nature and scope of the vulnerability and respond accordingly.
4. **Stay in Communication** – After reporting, please respond to any further inquiries from us so that we can work together to address the issue.

## Expected Response

1. **Acknowledgment** – We aim to acknowledge your disclosure within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation & Validation** – We will investigate the report and validate its accuracy. This timeline can vary based on the complexity of the issue.
3. **Confidentiality** – We respect your privacy and will not share your personal information or the disclosure details without your explicit consent.
4. **Disclosure Timeline** – Once the issue is resolved, we will work with you to determine an appropriate public disclosure timeline.
5. **Recognition** – While we don't currently have a bug bounty program, we believe in recognizing the hard work and effort of security researchers. Your name (with consent) will be added to a "Thank You" section in our documentation.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security and safety of our community and users!
